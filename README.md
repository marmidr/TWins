# TWins in brief

`TWins` is a C++ library designed for easy creation of visual terminal applications on non-os platforms, like bare Cortex-M3.
It provides basic facilities required by interactive applications such as screen and cursor management, keyboard input, keymaps, color codes.
User can also define terminal windows and it's widgets in a convenient way as const tree of `twins::Widget` structures.

Implementation is based on examples:

# Prerequisites

Library is using C++14 and reguires gcc 7.5 or never.

```bash
sudo apt install g++ cmake cmake-curses-gui
```

# How to build demo

Project is CMake-based and contains two targets: *TWinsDemo* and *TWinsUT*.  
Tests are enabled by default, Demo has to be enabled from commandline or in `ccmake .`.

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DTWINS_BUILD_DEMO=ON -DTWINS_THEME_DIR="../demo/inc/" ..
make -j
```

### Run GUI demo:

```bash
./bin/TWinsDemo
```

### Run CLI demo:

```bash
./bin/TWinsDemo --cli
```

## How to build unit tests

TWins tests are using google test library as a submodule.
The first step is to fetch the library:

```bash
cmake -DTWINS_BUILD_UT=ON ..
git submodule update --init
```

You can also turn on building of the tests with `ccmake`:  
Go to build/ and use `ccmake .` to turn on `TWINS_BUILD_UT`.  
Press `c` -> `c` -> `g` to reconfigure build scripts

### Build and run the tests

```bash
make -j
ctest -V
```

If you have `gcovr` installed, after running tests you can generate test coverage HTML report

```bash
make twins_cov_only
firefox cover_html/cover.html
```
